# just-another-java-smpp-lib
Just uploaded for history keeping purposes. I implemented this library when no better open source alternatives where available.

It implements the version 3.4 of the SMPP protocol

Initial work and proof-of-concept on USSD dynamic menus were implemented drived by an xml format.

This project needs to be mavenized and if interested you can contact me to continue this work hofmanndavid@gmail.com
